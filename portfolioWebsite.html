  <h4> About Me </h4>
<h3>I was born in Milford Massachusetts but moved into a town called Hopkinton by the age of 3. I grew up with a loving family who cared for me and wanted me to take pride in my education. When I was very young I got intrested in Computer Science from taking a summer camp. This led me to take multiple compouter science courses in High School and want me to progress it further in college. Some of my other hobbies and intrests include Soccer and 3d printing.</h3>

    <h6>Computer Science!</h6>
I started my love of Computer Science when I took a python course in 7th grade. I instantly fell in love with the idea of making what ever I want. Most of my knowledge of the field came from my two computer science courses in highschool (Computer Science Principles, Computer Science A). These courses made me find a love for solving problems while having fun in the process (espically java in Computer Science A). At this point in my life I currently know 4 languages, Python, C, Java, Html/Css/Javascript.
